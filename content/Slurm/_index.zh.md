The **Slurm Workload Manager**, formerly known as **Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM**), or simply **Slurm**, is a [free and open-source](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job scheduler for Linux and Unix-like kernels, used by many of the world's supercomputers and computer clusters.

It provides three key functions:

- allocating exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can perform work,
- providing a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work, typically a parallel job such as Message Passing Interface (MPI) on a set of allocated nodes, and
- arbitrating contention for resources by managing a queue of pending jobs.
